Culture
We built a culture around freedom and responsibility, high-performing individuals and teams, discipline, quality of interactions and outcomes, empathy and something we call Axia.

I wanted to write about our culture. I'm mostly driven because I do a lot of interviews for my open roles and people want to know what type of organization they are joining, which is a reasonable expectation. Candidates want to know if they will be treated like drones, devoid of agency and incentivized to work long hours, or if it will be a wonderful place to indulge in all their professional fantasies.

Well, the short answer is neither. Instead, we built a culture around [freedom and responsibility](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture#freedom-and-responsibility), high-performing individuals and teams, [discipline](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/a-culture-of-discipline.html), quality of interactions and outcomes, empathy and something we call Axia. It might sound loaded, but it does not mean we don't have any fun or laughter around the office. In fact, we joke around a fair bit, and working at Flint is the most fun many of us have ever had.

## Freedom and Responsibility
It sounds great off the bat, but in reality, it's a tool for management to develop high-performing teams. Because no one can ever get off the hook, everyone is held responsible at all times for the outcomes they drive, and in return, they can do it the way they see fit.

Of course, this does not mean chaos; and instead, everyone takes a very deliberate set of actions to get to the finish line. You are expected to do your best to socialize your plan, findings, learnings and make the best decisions to drive the outcomes you are responsible for while doing less, yet just enough, essentially being Lean. We fail all the time, but we take the responsibility to learn from failures, not to repeat them: freedom to fail, responsibility to learn.

## High-Performing Teams
You may wonder why freedom and responsibility lead to high-performing teams? Since we have absolute agency in the methods we use, and the decisions we make to reach good customer outcomes. We have an intrinsic motivation to make the right ones. We feel deeply responsible and proud, yet critical. We measure our success by frequently measuring good customer outcomes, which keeps the team accountable and leads to high performance.

## Empathy
Doing the right thing takes empathy and a lot of it. Empathy for the customers, colleagues, and partners, empathy to understand.

What happens with an organization like ours filled with carefully empathetic people is that we are more attuned to what people feel and want. We listen more and pay more attention. It creates a place where people are heard, where we get the incredible benefit of hearing out everyone's ideas, creating a community of thought where no matter your job, you have the same opportunity to contribute.

Because of our collective empathy, we become better at building a better product. We understand what jobs the customers are hiring our product to do. We do this independently of our ideas and biases. This capacity to listen and better understand becomes a superpower for everyone and in all spheres of the organization.

## Axia (αξία)
Axia is the ancient Greek word for figurative value, merit, and worth. But we made the meaning broader. _Axia is the space we create between each other, which expresses the deep value we hold for one another. Axia is what creates the safety to give and receive honest feedback. Axia is what encourages everyone to listen deeply and express humility because there is much more we don't know yet._

We create a safe place to be humble and empathetic, caring and critical when enacting Axia. It encompasses all our cultural values; our culture is Axia.
