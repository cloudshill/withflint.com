How Flint Thinks About Growth & Product
Growth and a great product are 2 of the most important areas every startup needs to focus on to be successful. In many ways these two things are intertwined: you can’t have growth without a great product and a great product without growth doesn’t matter because nobody is using it. So how we think about this is critical to our success.

Growth and a great product are 2 of the most important areas every startup needs to focus on to be successful. In many ways these two things are intertwined: you can’t have growth without a great product and a great product without growth doesn’t matter because nobody is using it. So how we think about this is critical to our success. After having had a handful of conversations on this topic over the last month, I decided to put these thoughts into writing to provide visibility for the whole Flint community.

## So what do we mean when we say growth?

We mean growth that builds a multi-billion dollar company in under 5 years. Growth like the ‘[Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/)’ rate that Neeraj promoted. Growth that supports venture backed returns. When we talk about growth we are talking about outlier growth.

## What do we mean when we say a great product?

We mean a product that creates tangible, no brainer value for its customers. A product that solves a small or big problem, but the total addressable market value is immense (ie. big TAM). A simple product that scales to meet our growth goals. To achieve this we need a process that puts business outcomes before less powerful outputs ([a nod to Marty Cagan](https://svpg.com/focus-on-value/)).

## Okay, but which one is more important?

This is a key question that every founder must ask. Are you going to be product led or growth led? In our last company, Oco Meals (a meal prep platform), we prioritized growth at all costs. Every week we had targets to grow by 5%+ (we pulled this from [Jim Collins’ 20 mile march principle](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/twenty-mile-march.html)). Consistent growth was our North Star, and we grew 30% month on month! But when we hit $2M in sales, growth got harder. At this point we did not have a strong product vision, but we had a strong growth vision. Our product was good but many elements would need substantial effort to bring it to great. To top it off, we didn’t fully understand who our core customer was. There was a lack of no brainer value in our product.

Ultimately, the lesson we learned was without a great product, growth won’t be sustained in a way we need to hit our growth philosophy. So after a deep dive into these problems our team concluded that we were not the right people to deliver value for a consumer food product. We were a team of engineers who were more concerned about cost and convenience than taste and experience. So we pivoted. Sold the business and dove into Flint. We took 4 months of dedicated time doing customer discovery and spoke with over 100 chefs across the country to ensure a real sample size for true value creation. It worked! We launched Flint with great success, doubling month on month, and had true customer pull. We had built something people wanted!

These lessons shaped how all of us at Flint think about growth and product. We believe that through disciplined discovery and a great product comes the outlier growth we target. We know there will be many trade offs on the path to build a multi-billion dollar organization, but we hope that this glimpse into how we think about product and growth let’s you get to know our team more and understand our Flint updates better.
