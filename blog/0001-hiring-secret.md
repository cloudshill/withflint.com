I Have a Hiring Secret
Competition is for losers. Peter Thiel makes a compelling argument about it in his 2014 Startup School talk "If you start a company, you always aim for monopoly and avoid competition; hence competition is for losers". Why should hiring be diffrent?

A lot of people know about my secret, but knowledge is not sufficient; you need to use it. It's daring and the opposite of good practice. It goes against the job market. It looks harder, and big tech is not doing it, so you might think it's a bad idea, and that's what makes it a secret.

I build my technology stack on functional programming (FP) technologies and hire for it. I have a few beliefs that support this decision-making. I believe that FP is more interesting than imperative programming. That FP drives the team to make better technical decisions. That you learn more fundamental knowledge, which is more useful and easier to translate between technologies. That you write better programs for the user with FP. That the quality of output is better and thus the customer outcomes are also better since there are fewer bugs and fewer side effects. That you need a smaller team to arrive at the same outcomes.

While those are reasons why I like FP, those aren't the secret. I see hiring as a good product. With a good experience, like you can imagine an Apple product or the Airbnb user experience.

Apple creates monopolies because they produce unique, innovative products. Think about the iPhone; while today, it has been copied multiple times, originally, it was groundbreaking, and it still resides supreme at the top of the US market share leader board. The whole experience of buying an iPhone is excellent, and the customers love it so much, almost everyone with an iPhone will argue that you should get one too.

Airbnb did a similar thing. They created a well-designed innovative product that didn't compete with the established hotel industry; they had a secret: they knew people would rent out their guest rooms to strangers over the internet. As a result, renting a vacation place on Airbnb is 10X better than doing it on any contenders' websites; it is excellent.

Competition is for losers. Peter Thiel makes a compelling argument about it in his 2014 Startup School talk "If you start a company, you always aim for monopoly and avoid competition; hence competition is for losers".

If you start a tech company and imitate Google, Amazon, or Microsoft with technologies like Java, Python, C#, you will be setting yourself up for competition. Not only with them but also all the tens of thousands of other imitators. It will likely not matter to the incumbents, but it will be very hard to compete in that hiring market for you.

Instead, I choose to offer something you cannot get at big tech, FP, a safe place to write delightful code that satisfies all your obsession about Types and Monads, Lambda Calculus and Category Theory.

Detractor of my hiring philosophy often makes the case that it's impossible to find sufficient talent with these constraints because the pool of candidates is too small. That does not matter; I'm not looking for 1000 new programmers this year alone. But even if I was, according to Stackoverflow's latest yearly survey, 25% of programmers use an FP language, it seems like a sufficiently large pool to me.

Then we have very successful startup exits. For example, Whatsapp, which used Erlang, was sold to Facebook in 2014 for $16 billion. At their acquisition, Whatsapp had a tiny software team of 35 engineers. Another more recent example is Jet.com which used F#, Microsoft's take on FP, sold to Walmart for $3 billion. The company was only two years old. This informs me that the tech stack is irrelevant to the exit; the business and customer outcomes ultimately are; FP is here to help.
