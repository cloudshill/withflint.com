                wholesalers. If you find yourself spending hours comparing pricing, or if you have given up trying to
                get competitive pricing every week and have settled with
                a few suppliers, then this is a great fit for you!

              </h4>
              <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">If something is missing or bad you can connect directly with your
                account manager to rectify any issue. As a collective we are able to help advocate on your behalf with
                wholesalers, with strength in numbers, when needed.</p>

              <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">Today we’re focused on working with meat and seafood wholesalers. In the
                future, we’ll be adding produce and dry goods wholesalers to our network. Our goal is to be a one stop

              </h4>
              <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">As a collective we are able to use the group buying power to negotiate
                price savings for everyone. We work with most of the wholesalers in lower mainland to get up-to-date
                pricing every time you order! Comparing so many suppliers
                assures that you are not missing out on any savings.

              </h4>
              <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">We make money by finding you savings, and then sharing in those savings
                50/50 for the first 3 months. After 3 months, we take a small fee of cost + 5%. For example, if we can
                help you save $100 on your order, we would split
                that half-half, so $50 for you, and $50 for us. After 3 months, our share will drop to a cost + 5%
                model. It takes a lot of work to stay on top of the best prices as the market is changing all the time,
                so these fees help
                us cover the costs of helping you manage relationships with wholesalers, negotiating prices on your
                behalf, and always finding you the best prices every week.

                us at any time. Our goal is to win your business by providing the absolute best service and prices in
                town, and by consistently doing that month after
                month, year after year. If you are not satisfied with our service, you can stop purchasing from us at

                is the most convenient and cost effective way for you to pay. We do not accept credit cards because of
                the additional fees that are charged by the big credit
                card companies, which will eventually be passed on to you through higher prices or fees. Our goal is to
                help you save as much money as possible, and supporting credit cards goes against this.

              <p class="section-paragraph mb-0">The order deadline is 11:00am to guarantee next day delivery. The
                earlier you place your order, the better pricing you can get. This is because every wholesaler has
                different order deadlines, so the earlier you place your order,
                the more price lists we can compare for you.
